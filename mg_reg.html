            <h3>Please Read the following Instructions carefully...</h3>

                <li>Each round has 3 unlocking puzzles which helps to go from one round to another.</li>
                <li>
                    Questions will be such that not much professional knowledge of mathematics is required (upto +2 and some
                    undergrad things) so that everybody will be on same page.
                </li>
                <li>It is open to all age groups.</li>
                <li><strong>Entry Fees:</strong> 50 Rs. per head which should be payed at the time of online registration.</li>
                <li>Prize money worth Rs. 2,000</li>
                <li>
                    Note that in Round 6 or 7, upon solving each problem correctly you have to send the logic behind your answer
                    to mathgeek.integration@gmail.com. You can do this by either of the following methods.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You may write the logic in a piece of paper in legible handwriting and then click a clear picture of
                            that and send it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Or you may write the logic in Ms-Word or any of your favourite Word processing software and send the
                            .doc (or .pdf) file.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    NOTE THAT YOUR IMAGE OR WORD FILE NAME SHOULD BE LIKE “R6,P1” IF IT CONTAINS THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEM 1 OF
                    ROUND 6.IF YOU DON’T FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THESE ROUNDS YOU WON’T BE CONSIDERED FOR REWARDS
                    IRRESPECTIVE OF HOW MUCH YOU HAVE PROCEEDED.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Note that you can attempt a single question at most 10 times in round 1-3. This maximum number of attempts
                    will be reduced to 5 for Round 4-5 and will be further reduced to 3 in Round 6-9. SO, USE YOUR PRECIOUS
                    ATTEMPTS WISELY!
                </li>
                <li>
                    For answers in numbers, you should answer that number without any blank space. If an answer is Infinity, then
                    type INFINITE as your answer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For answers in words, type the letters in Capital. So, if the answer is 'Integration', then type 'INTEGRATION'
                    as your answer (without the quotes).
                </li>
                <li>
                    For a question that asks for two answers, separate the answers by a comma. For example, if the answer to two
                    sub-questions are "Apple" and "1234", then type your answer as APPLE,1234
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the answer is 5tan(pi/15), where pi is the ratio of the perimeter to the diameter of a circle, then answer
                    this as 5TAN(PI/15)
